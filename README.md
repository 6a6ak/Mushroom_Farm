# Mushroom_Farm
Code for Controlling the situation of the mushroom farming salon.
To make a good mushroom product, you need stable humidity and temperature, which is impossible for a human to control. 
However, by automating the farm or salon via Arduino, these conditions can easily be maintained. 
First, the microcontroller receives data from the humidity sensor and controls the humidity pump and air conditioning relay.
Furthermore, the project contains a SIM800 module that sends SMS to specific phone numbers based on the temperature and humidity thresholds.
